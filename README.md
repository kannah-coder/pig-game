## Rules
1. The game supports **1 to 4 players**.
2. On each turn, a player may roll the dice as many times as they like:
   - If the player rolls a **1**, they lose all points for that turn and their turn ends.
   - If they roll **2â€“6**, the value is added to their **current turn score**.
3. At any point, the player may choose **not to roll** and "hold".  
   - Their **turn score is added to total score**.
4. The first player to reach **100 points** wins the game. ðŸŽ‰
